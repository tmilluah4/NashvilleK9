					<p>	Our background includes the daily training of Police, Search and Rescue, Detection, and Personal Protection dogs. In service to the community, we voluntarily run government K-9 units, assisting municipalities in Police and Search & Rescue cases at no charge to citizens or government entities. We also provide several demonstrations per month to various schools, pet stores, humane society functions, churches, and more. As authorized instructors for the American Red Cross, we offer Pet First Aid instruction to children undergoing Lifesaver Camp, as well as adults interested in learning Pet First Aid in the Middle Tennessee area. We believe that volunteer service is a critical component of giving back to the community and showing our appreciation.</p> 

					<p>	Our breeding program includes hand-selected, internationally certified canines from Europe, with superior work drive, high energy, tremendous intelligence, and obedience that surpasses our competition. The extra time we spend in Europe testing protection dogs and police dogs ensures the finest quality that trainers in the U.S. seldom offer. You can be confident that we hand pick each, and every dog and we personally guarantee lifetime training with every protection dog purchased from us. In the rare occurrence of any problem or conflict, we’ll replace your protection dog with one of equal value.</p>
